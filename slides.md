### 1. Use reference sources to find and/or narrow your research topic.

What is a reference source?

A reference source summarizes and synthesizes secondary sources. Typically, a reference source does not contain original research. These sources provide important background and contextual information on your subject.

Examples of reference sources:
* Bibliography
* Dictionary / Encyclopedia
* Handbook


### 2. Find the right database for you
There is no one perfect database

* Do I need primary sources or secondary sources?
* What kind of primary source do I need? (Critical edition, newspaper, or something else?)
* Do I need a primary source from a particular time period or location?
* Do I need a book or an article?
* Do I need a specific disciplinary focus?


### 3. Use the important words from your topic as "keywords" when searching a catalog or database.

What is a keyword?  

What is your working topic?


### 3. Find subject terms relevant to your topic.

What is a subject term?  
How is it different from a keyword?

Subject terms are **controlled vocabularies** assigned to items by librarians. Subject searches may return fewer items, but the results are usually more relevant.

#### How to find subject terms
1. Examine the subject terms associated with items returned from keyword searching.
2. Browse the subject terms used in the database.


### 4. Use subject terms to find relevant primary sources

"Primary source" is not a subject term, but you can use the following:
* sources
* diaries
* correspondence
* personal narratives
* notebooks, sketchbooks, etc


### Interlude: Try it out
1. Write down your research topic.  
2. Identify the most important terms in your topic.  
3. Use those terms as a keyword search in *JumboSearch*.  
4. After finding a few useful sources, identify the subject terms used for those sources.  
5. Search the *library catalog* using the subject terms.
6. Use subject terms to find primary sources on your topic.  


### 5. Use complex searches when necessary

#### Boolean operators
* Use AND, OR, or NOT in your searches to expand or limit them.

#### Wildcards
* Wildcard characters allow you to easily search for variants of words.  
* Example: "rac*" will search for "race," "racism," and "racist" (but it will also search for "racing")


### 6. Use published bibliographies to find sources

* [Oxford Bibliographies](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=OBO)  
* [The American Historical Association's Guide to Historical Literature](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/14dinuo/01TUN_ALMA51273467800003851) 


### 7. Use Google, but use it wisely.

Using Google wisely
* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous searches.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


### 8. Keep track of your research
