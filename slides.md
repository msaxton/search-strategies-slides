## Research Strategies

### 2. Use reference sources to help you find and/or narrow your research topic

A reference source summarizes and synthesizes secondary sources. Typically, a reference source does not contain original research. These sources provide important background and contextual information on your subject.


### 3. A narrowly defined research topic will streamline your research process.

"A [research] topic is an approach to a subject, one that asks a question whose answer solves a problem that your readers care about." (Booth et al., 2014)

Topics should be narrow enough to direct your research and fit within the parameters of your assignment.

General topic: Representations of queerness in the media

Narrow topic: The conflict between _machismo_ and queer identity in recent Latin American film

#### Name your topic
I am researching...

**I am researching** the conflict between _machismo_ and queer identity in recent Latin American film

#### Ask a question
...because I want to find out who/what/where/when/wether/why/how..

**because I want to find out how** how these films portray masculinity

#### Identify the significance of your research
...in order to help my reader understand...

**in order to help my reader understand** how the media plays a role in the construction of gender norms.

### 4. Combine keywords and subject terms to get more relevant search results

* Keywords ("Any field") searches:
    * title
    * author
    * table of contents / summary (if available)
    * subjects

Subject terms are **controlled vocabularies** assigned to items by librarians. Subject searches may return fewer items, but the results are usually more relevant.

#### How to find subject terms
1. Examine the subject terms associated with items returned from keyword searching.
2. Browse the subject terms used in the database.

### 5. Know the scope of what you are searching

* JumboSearch
* library catalogue
* libraries worldwide
* databases


### 6. Use Google, but use it wisely.

Using Google wisely
* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous searches.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


### 7. Read strategically

* Read the introduction and conclusion first
* Scan the table of contents and indexes
* Consult book reviews


### 8. Keep track of your research
