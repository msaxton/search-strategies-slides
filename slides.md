### 2. Reference sources can help you find and/or narrow your research topic.

What is a reference source?

A reference source summarizes and synthesizes secondary sources. Typically, a reference source does not contain original research. These sources provide important background and contextual information on your subject.

Examples of reference sources:
* Dictionary / Encyclopedia
* Handbook


### 3. Bibliographies are tools, not formalities.

Use published bibliographies or the bibliographies in scholarly literature to help you find sources.


### 4. The who, what, where, when, and why of your research topic can be used as keywords when searching library catalogs and databases.

What is a keyword?

* Keywords ("Any field") searches:
    * title
    * author
    * table of contents / summary (if available)
    * subjects

What is your working topic?


### 5. There is no perfect database.

* Do I need primary or secondary sources?
* What kind of primary source do I need?
* Do I need a primary sources from a specific time period or region?
* What kind of secondary source do I need?
* Do I need a specific disciplinary focus like sociology or history?


### 6. Move from keyword searching to subject term searching

Subject terms are **controlled vocabularies** assigned to items by librarians. Subject searches may return fewer items, but the results are usually more relevant.

#### How to find subject terms
1. Examine the subject terms associated with items returned from keyword searching.
2. Browse the subject terms used in the database.

Subject terms can also be used to find primary sources:

* archival resources
* archives
* broadsides
* case studies
* correspondence
* diaries
* maps
* newspapers
* personal narratives
* sermons
* sources
* speeches, addresses, etc.


### 7. Use Google, but use it wisely.

Using Google wisely
* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous searches.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


### 8. Keep track of your research
