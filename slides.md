### 1. Know what you are searching

What is the difference between "JumboSearch", "Tufts Catalog", and "Libraries Worldwide"?

Compare the following databases:
* [America: History and Life](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=AmerHistLife) 
* [Historical Abstracts](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=HistAbs)
* [Essay and General Literature Index](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=FSEssayGenLint)
* [JSTOR](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=JSTOR)


### 2. Use the important words from your topic as "keywords" when searching a catalog or database.

What is a keyword?  

Example Topic:  
The impact of Sulla's dictatorship in the Roman Republic on Cicero's developing political thought.

The impact of <mark>Sulla</mark>'s dictatorship in the <mark>Roman Republic</mark> on <mark>Cicero</mark>'s developing <mark>political thought</mark>.


### 3. Find subject terms relevant to your topic.

What is a subject term?  
How is it different from a keyword?

#### How to find subject terms
1. Examine the subject terms associated with items returned from keyword searching.
2. Browse the subject terms used in the database.


### 4. Use subject terms to find relevant primary sources

"Primary source" is not a subject term, but you can use the following:
* sources
* diaries
* correspondence
* personal narratives
* notebooks, sketchbooks, etc


### Interlude: Try it out
1. Write down your research topic.  
2. Identify the most important terms in your topic.  
3. Use those terms as a keyword search in JumboSearch.  
4. After finding a few useful sources, identify the subject terms used for those sources.  
5. Search JumboSearch using the subject terms.
6. Use subject terms to find primary sources on your topic.  



### 5. Use wildcards when necessary

Wildcard characters allow you to easily search for variants of words.  

Example: "rac*" will search for "race," "racism," and "racist" (but it will also search for "racing")


### 6. Use the tools provided by the database.

##### [JSTOR](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=JSTOR)
* JSTOR Understanding Series
* Text Analyzer  

##### [Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) Daily Reports](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=RsrcRcrdFBIS)
* Events


### 7. Use published bibliographies to find sources
* [Oxford Bibliographies](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=OBO)  
* [The American Historical Association's Guide to Historical Literature](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/14dinuo/01TUN_ALMA51273467800003851)
